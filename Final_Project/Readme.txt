Project title: 
Benchmark performance comparison of In-order and Out-of-order CPU using ARM8 system in Gem5 

Project description:
(Type 4 project)

We will be implementing In-order and out-of-order CPU in ARM. For the project, we aim to follow the guide and study of the configuration files in both the CPUs. A detailed review of the performance parameters will be obtained from the test benchmarks. We intend to use benchmarks like bubblesort, FloatMM, qsort, matmatrix multiplication and bitcount to see the overall performance of the system. For the final conclusion we will be stating which CPU performs better with four performance metrics (total consumed energy, throughput, average cycles per instruction, k2 cache miss rate). 


Work distribution:
Mohit : Build ARM architecture on gem5 using In-order CPUs and Out-of-order CPUs. Understand and evaluate parameters amongst both the CPUs

Haritha : Evaluate and compile the benchmarks. Evaluate whether the benchmarks can be executed with ARM architecture

Srajana : Evaluate overall performance of In-order and Out-of-order CPU; establish relation between the four performance metrics.
